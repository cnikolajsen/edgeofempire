      %p{style: "font-size: 11px;"} Each character starts with a single specialization within his chosen career. However, he may purchase access to any additional specializations in any career.
      %p{style: "font-size: 11px;"} The character gains a number of bonus class skills from each specialization, but only the first specialization chosen awards free ranks in a number of these bonus class skills.
      %p{style: "font-size: 11px;"} Purchasing an additional specialization within a character’s career costs ten times the total number of specializations he would possess with this new specialization. So a character with one specialization  could purchase a second career specialization for 20 experience. If he wished to purchase a third career specialization, it would cost 30 experience.
      %p{style: "font-size: 11px;"} Characters may also purchase additional specializations outside of their career. Purchasing non-career specializations costs ten times the total number of specializations he would possess with this new  specialization, plus an additional 10 experience. So a character with one specialization could purchase a second–non-career–specialization for 30 experience. If he had two specializations already, a third   specialization that was also a non-career specialization would cost 40 experience.
