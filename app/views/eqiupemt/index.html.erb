  <p>What a player chooses as a career for his character defines the overall and ongoing  commitment to a way f life for that character. A career is more than just what a character does for a living - it is his way of life, encompassing his goals, his passions, his training, and his destiny. Areas of focus may change over time, but a character will never truly stop being whatever it is he chose to be at his core.</p>
